=head1 Name

YAML Dev Kit - Resources for YAML Framework Developers

=head1 Overview

This is a set of resources that developers can refer to when developing
software for YAML. It is intended to be used along with L<the YAML
specification|http://www.yaml.org/spec/spec.html>.

The kit includes:

=over

=item Implementation Guides

A set of documents that cover all the known topics a YAML developer might need
to deal with.

=item Comprehensive Test Suite

This is a data driven suite that is intended to cover every known situation of
YAML processing.

=item Interactive YAML Testing Tool

A commandline tool that you can use to test out all the known YAML
implementations.

=head1 Implementation Guides

So far there is:

=over

=item * L<YAML Loader Guide|/yaml-loader-guide>

=back

=head1 Comprehensive Test Suite

This test suite is composed of (what will eventually be) 100s of test
directories that each represent a specific situation for a YAML processor.
Each test directory contains a number of related files, that test suites can
be made to use in interesting ways. For example:

=over

=item * Metadata about the test

=over

=item * Name (short phrase)

=item * Tags

=item * Description

=back

=item * Input YAML

=item * Canonical Output YAML

=item * Matching JSON

=item * Token stream notation

=item * Event stream notation

=item * Error data

=item * etc

=back

Not every test dir will have the same elements. Since the tests are just data,
it is up to the framework using the tests to decide which tests to use and how
to use them.

The tests are currently written in TestML under the C<test> directory on the
C<master> branch. The test data is split into the separate files structure,
and kept on the C<data> branch. This makes tests easier to groom.

=head1 Interactive YAML Testing Tool

Work has begun to create a Docker container image that has all known YAML
implementations and tools pre-installed and that exposes a CLI to interact
with it in interesting ways:

    alias yt='docker run -it ingy/yt'
    cat file.yaml | yt --ruby --json     # Load YAML with Ruby and dump as JSON
    cat file.yaml | yt --python --event  # Show PyYAML event stream
    yt --shell --perl --yamlxs           # Start a YAML Shell using Perl's YAML::XS
