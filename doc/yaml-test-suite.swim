YAML Test Suite
===============

Comprehensive Test Suite for YAML

= Overview

This test suite is composed of (what will eventually be) 100s of test
directories that each represent a specific situation for a YAML processor. Each
test directory contains a number of related files, that test suites can be made
to use in interesting ways. For example:

* Metadata about the test
  * Name (short phrase)
  * Tags
  * Description
* Input YAML
* Canonical Output YAML
* Matching JSON
* Token stream notation
* Event stream notation
* Error data
* etc

Not every test dir will have the same elements. Since the tests are just data,
it is up to the framework using the tests to decide which tests to use and how
to use them.

The tests are currently written in TestML under the `test` directory on the
`master` branch. The test data is split into the separate files structure, and
kept on the `data` branch. This makes tests easier to groom.

To get a quick overview of the tests you can have a look at the "YAML Test
Matrix"[http://matrix.yaml.io/]
- [https://github.com/perlpunk/yaml-test-matrix].

== Updating the Data Branch

To update the data branch under a directory called `data`, run:
```
make data-update`
```

You will need NodeJS and CoffeeScript. To install `coffee` after you have
`node`, run:
```
npm install -g coffee
```
